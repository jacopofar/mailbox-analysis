# Mbox mail analysis

This is a script that analyzes an mbox mail export, such as the one provided by Google Takeout from a Gmail box, and produces a report on the content.

## Reports

* mail per day over time
* most active addresses
* TODO average mail length

## Usage

Then, run this command:

    TODO insert here the command
